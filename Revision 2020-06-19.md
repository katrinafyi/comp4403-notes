# Revision

There are **two parts**. Part A is worth 30% and is a Blackboard quiz. Part B is 70% and to be done one paper.

### Likely questions

- Parsing theory, including regular expressions and context-free grammars.
- Deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, translating regex to NFA and NFA to DFA.
- First and follow sets, top-down (LL(1)) and bottom-up (LR(0), LR(1), LALR(1)).
- RDP, including semantic actions.
- Runtime environment:
  - Stack organisation, frames, call, return, static/dynamic links, parameter and return mechanisms.
  - Handling of objects: classes, subclasses, dynamic dispatch.
  - Heap organisation: alloc/dealloc, GC, mark-and-sweep, stop-and-copy, generational.
- Static semantics: symbol tables, inference rules and derivations.

### Topics

- ...
- Type inference rules, well-formedness of statements.
- Remember that first sets can contain the empty string iff the construct is nullable.

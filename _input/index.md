# COMP4403 &mdash; Compilers and Interpreters

Lectured by Ian Hayes at UQ in Semester 1 of 2020. Notes typed by Kenton Lam.
All mistakes are almost surely my own.

**Summary pages:** [recursive descent parsing](/Recursive%20Descent%20Parsing/),
[shift/reduce parsing](/Shift-Reduce%20Parsing/), 
[static semantics](/Static%20Semantics/).

**Useful links:** [single page view](/Single%20Page/) (somewhat broken).

# Lecture 11 - CUP and JFlex Example

> March 31, 2020

Java-CUP takes a grammar in a particular format and generates code which, when given a sequence of tokens can construct an AST and evaluate it.

JFlex takes token definitions as regular expressions and returns a tokeniser which will convert input into those tokens.
